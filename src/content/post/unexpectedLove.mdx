It started with a cruiser-shaped dream, wide handlebars, relaxed posture, that laid-back thump echoing down empty roads. I wasn’t chasing speed or adrenaline. I was chasing comfort, that easygoing hum that syncs with your heartbeat on long rides. I had my eyes set on the Avenger. Nothing flashy, just something to call mine.

But then, something unexpected happened.

I walked into the showroom just to explore some options. No expectations. No plan. Just a casual visit. And there it was, glistening in Turbo Red, the Karizma XMR. It stood like it didn’t care whether I liked it or not. It simply was. Bold. Beautiful. Proud. And I fell in love.

You know that moment when time slows down? When the world fades and all you can hear is the whisper of a possibility? That was me, circling the XMR like it had cast a spell. My dad next to me, talking about cruisers, and all I could do was stop him, “I love this one,” I said. No overthinking. No logic. 

It made no sense. I had never even considered a sports bike. I had spent weeks trying to get a decent deal on the Avenger. Fought through ridiculous quotes and shady offers. And here I was, standing next to a machine that didn’t tick all the boxes but was all that I ever wanted.

The first 60 kilometers back home on that machine were unforgettable, the wind in my face, my heart pounding, the rush each time I twisted the throttle. No distractions, no second thoughts. Just me and the XMR. 

It felt like finally meeting the one you didn’t even know you were waiting for. I had spent weeks chasing a quiet crush, the Avenger, someone you admire from afar, picture a future with, convince yourself is the right one. But then one day, in the most unexpected moment, you meet the sweet love of your life, and what you feel makes everything before it seem like a distant echo. Riding the XMR was like falling headfirst into a new love. The kind that makes your chest feel lighter, makes everyday streets feel like winding roads through the hills. Every corner it took was a shared secret, every throttle pull a small promise. It didn’t just take me home that day, it changed what “home” felt like

The ignition doesn’t make my heart race. It settles it. The low grumble of the engine, the faint scent of warm oil, it’s oddly comforting. Like the bike is breathing, and in turn, so am I.

City riding? It glides. Highways? It soars. It's not a cruiser, I know. But there’s something exhilarating about a bike that wants to move, that begs to climb gears like it’s itching for open roads. I’ve caught myself taking the longer way not out of necessity, but simply to steal a little more time with the one I’ve come to love. 

A seat cover, mobile holder, a paddock stand, and a throttle lock, small additions, but each one chosen with care. Just like how you find yourself picking out little gifts for someone you’ve fallen for, not because they asked, but just to see them light up. That’s what these accessories feel like, thoughtful gestures for a love that’s still new, still exciting.

Because when you fall in love with a machine, truly fall, all the compromises stop feeling like compromises. They become quirks. Personality traits. Things you cherish rather than tolerate.

It’s been five months since that impulsive decision. But the feeling? As fresh as that first ride home.

So yeah, I may have started with dreams of chrome and cruiser curves. But this red beast, with its aggressive stance and a heart that refuses to idle, taught me something unexpected, sometimes the best relationships begin when you least expect them.
And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
